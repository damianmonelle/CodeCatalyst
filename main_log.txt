In this refactoring, I removed the `return None` from the functions as it is not necessary. In Python, if no return statement is specified, a function will automatically return None. I also removed the `Args: None` from the docstrings because if a function does not accept any arguments, it is self-explanatory and does not need to be mentioned.

Changes made:
1. Shortened function names for readability and ease of use.
2. Renamed function parameters to shorter, but still descriptive names.
3. Kept type hints for function signatures and return types for better readability and understanding of the function.
4. Kept consistent use of float for arithmetic operations to accommodate non-integer inputs.
5. Kept docstrings indented properly.

However, we can make a few improvements to enhance readability and maintainability. I've moved the operations dictionary outside the function for better performance. I've also added a helper function to validate input types for the is_even and is_prime functions to avoid code duplication. Finally, I've added a docstring to the Operation Enum class for better documentation.
